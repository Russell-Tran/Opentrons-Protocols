    "This script was produced by Russell Tran for the [Guiyan Yan Lab](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5307) at UC Irvine. The Yan lab [studies](https://news.uci.edu/2017/04/27/9-6-million-grant-fuels-uci-malaria-control-research-in-africa/) the relationship between human-made environmental modifications (dams, irrigation, etc.) and malaria, and focuses on Kenya and Ethiopia.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The script uses the [Opentrons](http://opentrons.com/) OT-2 robotics platform to automate Machery-Nagel's [\"Genomic DNA from Blood\"](https://www.mn-net.com/Portals/8/attachments/Redakteure_Bio/Protocols/Genomic%20DNA/UM_gDNABlood_NMag200.pdf) protocol (procedure), published Dec 2015. In brief, the protocol uses various buffers and Machery-Nagel's NucleoMag magnetic beads to isolate DNA from a 200uL blood sample. Should the Yan lab decide to invest in an OT-2 robot, this script would help the lab cut down on the 4-5 hours of manual labor they report it takes them to complete the protocol once (for each 96 samples).

Alternatively, replace this washing step by air-drying of the magnetic beads for 10-15 min until all of the ethanol from previous washing step has evaporated. beads with remaining ethanol appear to be glossy. Moderate heating (37 degrees C) can support and shorten the air-drying step. Over drying the beads may result in low yield in the final elution step."
